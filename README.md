- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rainer66eu
  Name: Rainer
  Born 1966
  From Europe (German, living in The Netherlands)
- Education: Diplom Informatiker (univ)
  Univeristy degree in Computer Science
  (somewhere between bachelor and master)

This is my first active contact with an OpenSource community.

Is OpenSource limited to software development?
Or are also e.g. standards being developed here?
How can I post something in GitHub?
